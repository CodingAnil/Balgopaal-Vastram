# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Fixes Applied

This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve Vercel deployment issues.

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### 1. **vercel.json** - Simplified and Optimized

- ✅ Removed unnecessary `buildCommand`, `outputDirectory`, `installCommand` (Vercel auto-detects these for Next.js)
- ✅ Removed conflicting `rewrites` configuration
- ✅ Kept essential `functions` configuration for API timeout
- ✅ Added `regions` specification for consistent deployment location
- ✅ Simplified to minimal required configuration

### 2. **next.config.js** - Enhanced for Production

- ✅ Added Cloudinary domain to `images.domains` for image optimization
- ✅ Added `serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['mongoose']` for database compatibility
- ✅ Added webpack configuration for client-side fallbacks
- ✅ Improved build configuration for serverless environment

### 3. **package.json** - Enhanced Scripts

- ✅ Added missing test scripts for CI/CD compatibility
- ✅ Added `next-sitemap` dependency for SEO
- ✅ Added `postbuild` script for sitemap generation
- ✅ Added `check-env` script for environment validation
- ✅ Added `prebuild` script to validate environment before build

## 🔌 Database & API Improvements

### 4. **Database Connection** (`src/lib/db.js`)

- ✅ Enhanced connection pooling for serverless environment
- ✅ Added connection validation and retry logic
- ✅ Improved error handling with descriptive messages
- ✅ Added IPv4 preference for better Vercel compatibility
- ✅ Added connection timeout configurations

### 5. **API Routes Error Handling**

- ✅ **Razorpay APIs**: Added environment variable validation
- ✅ **Upload API**: Moved Cloudinary config inside function with error handling
- ✅ **All APIs**: Enhanced error messages for production debugging

### 6. **Environment Validation Script** (`scripts/check-env.js`)

- ✅ Validates all required environment variables before build
- ✅ Provides clear feedback on missing configurations
- ✅ Helps prevent deployment failures due to missing env vars

### 7. **Sitemap Configuration** (`next-sitemap.config.js`)

- ✅ Automated sitemap generation for SEO
- ✅ Robots.txt generation
- ✅ Proper URL configuration for production

## 🔐 Required Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

### **Essential (Required)**

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_or_test_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_or_test_key_id
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

### **Recommended (Optional)**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Set Environment Variables**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add all required environment variables listed above
3. Make sure to set them for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### 2. **Redeploy**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
2. Click on the latest deployment → "Redeploy"
3. Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

### 3. **Verify Deployment**

1. Check build logs for any errors
2. Test API endpoints: `/api/products`, `/api/orders/create`
3. Verify database connection
4. Test payment integration
5. Check image upload functionality

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

1. **Build Fails with "Missing Environment Variable"**
   - Solution: Run `npm run check-env` locally to identify missing variables
   - Add missing variables to Vercel environment settings

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Solution: Verify `MONGODB_URI` is correct and database is accessible
   - Check MongoDB Atlas network access settings (allow 0.0.0.0/0)

3. **Payment Integration Not Working**
   - Solution: Verify Razorpay keys are correctly set
   - Check if using test/live keys consistently

4. **Image Upload Failing**
   - Solution: Verify all Cloudinary environment variables are set
   - Check Cloudinary account limits and settings

### **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Check environment variables locally
npm run check-env

# Test build locally
npm run build

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

## 📊 Performance Improvements

- ✅ Optimized database connections for serverless
- ✅ Improved API response times with better error handling
- ✅ Enhanced image optimization with Cloudinary domains
- ✅ Automated sitemap generation for better SEO
- ✅ Reduced bundle size with webpack optimizations

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify these work:

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Products page displays items from database
- [ ] Product detail pages work
- [ ] Cart functionality works
- [ ] Checkout process (both Razorpay and COD)
- [ ] Order creation and email notifications
- [ ] Admin panel access and product addition
- [ ] Image upload functionality
- [ ] Contact form submissions

## 🆘 Support

If deployment still fails:

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test API endpoints individually
4. Check database connection from Vercel function logs
5. Ensure all external services (MongoDB, Razorpay, SendGrid, Cloudinary) are properly configured

**Note**: These fixes address the most common Vercel deployment issues for Next.js applications with API routes, database connections, and third-party integrations.
